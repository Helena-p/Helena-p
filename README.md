### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Helena, a frontend developer

I transitioned into development in 2021 with nothing more than great curiosity, a desire to learn, and a willingness to put in all the effort that was needed for the work.

In my recent role, I participated in the MVP (minimal viable product) development for an early-stage start-up, and later took an active part in developing the new web application from start to delivery using Next.js, and Material UI on Swell.is platform backed with a PostgreSQL database. As a frontend developer at Circulate8, I worked in a team of two seniors and a UI designer, my responsibility was to create performant, reusable React components, implement new features, test, and general maintenance.
<br>
I am currently furthering my education within C#/.Net at Lexicon, LinkÃ¶ping. During this course, I will also pick up ASP.NET, SQL, Azure, and Blazor.

Alongside implementing new features, I highly enjoy maintaining and updating codebases to be performant, built for scale, and with accessibility in mind for including digital experience for all.<br><br>
