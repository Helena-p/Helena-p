### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Helena, a frontend developer

I work at [Circulate8](https://www.circulate8.com/), a young marketplace for all things packaging, aiming to speed up the world's transition towards more sustainable consumption and a circular economy. <br>

A junior frontend in a development team of 4. We launched our new headless e-commerce application in mid-September built in Next.js and Swell as a platform. We work agile in GitHub Flow according to the Kanban model. At Circulate, I have created:

- UI for our PostegresSQL database in Django for CRUD operations regarding product data
- the foundation for automated e2e testing with Cypress
- initiated checklist for PR reviews and a working document for the Circulate codestandard
- developed dashboard for users with functionality to create an account, save and update their data, update
passwords with validation, view order history, manage payments, create account and log in
- scaleable, reusable components in preparation for textcontent CMS optimised for accessibility and SEO
- static pages according to design specification in Figma
- pullrequest code reviews
- and much more ...
<br>

Alongside implementing new features, I highly enjoy maintaining and updating our codebase to be performant, built for scale, and with accessibility in mind for including digital experience for all.<br><br>
I continously strive to deepen my knowledge and below are some courses I have taken or are currently enrolled in:<br><br>
