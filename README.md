### Hi there 👋 I'm Helena, a frontend developer

I work as a front-end developer at [Circulate8](https://www.circulate8.com/), a marketplace for all things packaging, aiming to speed up the world's transition towards more sustainable consumption and a circular economy. We are a small tech team at Circulate8 and in our toolbox you find NextJs, Python/Django, PostgresSQL, Cypress ... I have a passion for accessibility, UX/UI and web performance.

I have studied frontend development with Code Institute and Sundsgarden FHS. During my studies I have gained the knowledge and to appreciate the value of clean, well written code. Code to be reusable and easily maintained in future codebases.
