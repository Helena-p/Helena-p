### Hi there 👋 I'm Helena, a frontend developer

I work at [Circulate8](https://www.circulate8.com/), a young marketplace for all things packaging, aiming to speed up the world's transition towards more sustainable consumption and a circular economy. 
At Circulate, I am part of a team of three developers and a UX/UI developer. This summer we transitioned our marketplace from a CMS-based MVP to a headless eCommerce Next.js application hosted on Swell.js, an API-first platform, and with Material UI component library. I also worked on the UI for our PostgreSQL database in Django, as well as implementing test automation in Cypress.

Daily, I work in Git/GitHub following agile practices (Kanban) with PR reviews. Alongside implementing new features, I highly enjoy maintaining and updating our codebase to be performant, built for scale, and with accessibility in mind for including digital experience for all.
