### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Helena, a frontend developer

I transitioned into development in 2021 with nothing more than great curiosity, a desire to learn, and a willingness to put in all the effort that was needed for the work.

In my recent role, I participated in the MVP (minimal viable product) development for an early-stage start-up, and later took an active part in developing the new web application from start to delivery. 


As a junior frontend developer at Circulate8 in a team of two seniors and a UI designer, my responsibility was to create performant, reusable React components, implement new features, test, and general maintenance. Some examples:

- UI for our PostgreSQL database in Django for CRUD operations regarding product data
- the foundation for automated e2e testing with Cypress
- initiated checklist for PR reviews and a working document for the Circulate code standard
- developed a dashboard for users with functionality to create an account, save and update their data, update
passwords with validation, view order history, manage payments, create an account, and log in
- scaleable, reusable components in preparation for text content CMS optimized for accessibility and SEO
- static pages according to design specifications in Figma
- pullrequest code reviews
<br>

Alongside implementing new features, I highly enjoy maintaining and updating codebases to be performant, built for scale, and with accessibility in mind for including digital experience for all.<br><br>
I continuously strive to deepen my knowledge and below are some courses I have taken or am currently enrolled in:<br><br>
**[Vanilla Js Academy / Chris Ferdinandi](https://vanillajsacademy.com/)**<br>
10-week project-based course in JavaScript focused on problem-solving. Smaller projects in DOM manipulation, APIs, async / await, XSS attacks, and creating own plug-ins, and modules.<br><br>
**[CSS Demystified / Kevin Powell](https://cssdemystified.com/)**<br>
Project-based immersion in CSS, modern CSS, and responsive design. Create an understanding of inheritance, specificity, 'the cascade', 'stacking context' and custom variables, etc.<br><br>
**[CSS for JavaScript Developers / Josh Comeau](https://css-for-js.dev/)**<br>
A comprehensive course designed to build an understanding of the deeper levels of CSS. Learn how the language really works, and empower to build robust user interfaces.<br><br>
