### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Helena, a frontend developer

I work at [Circulate8](https://www.circulate8.com/), a young marketplace for all things packaging, aiming to speed up the world's transition towards more sustainable consumption and a circular economy. <br>

A junior frontend in a development team of 4. We launched our new headless e-commerce application in mid-September built in Next.js and Swell as a platform. We work agile in GitHub Flow according to the Kanban model. At Circulate, I have created the UI for our PostegresSQL database in Django, the foundation for e2e testing with Cypress, initiated checklist for PR reviews and a working document for the Circulate code standard. 
In our Next.js application, I have among other things developed the functionality for users to create an account, save and update their data, update passwords with validation, static pages according to design specification in Figma, refactoring, code reviews and solving bugs.<br>

Alongside implementing new features, I highly enjoy maintaining and updating our codebase to be performant, built for scale, and with accessibility in mind for including digital experience for all.<br><br>
I continously strive to deepen my knowledge and below are some courses I have taken or are currently enrolled in:<br><br>
