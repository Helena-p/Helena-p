### Hi there 👋 I'm Helena, a frontend developer

I had applied and been accepted for higher education in Marketing Automation, but I was curious about coding and thought it would be a strength, working in digital marketing with coding skills. But, in fact, I enjoyed it so much that I decided to become a software developer instead.

I have studied frontend development with Code Institute and Sundsgarden FHS. During my studies I have gained the knowledge and to appreciate the value of clean, well written code. Code to be reusable and easily maintained in future codebases. I have collaborated with other students in several projects with agile work processes and, designed web applications to be responsive and inclusive to all users.

New to this industry I take every opportunity to learn from my seniors and peers, also I highly encourage and value constructive feedback to be able to grow further in my field.
