### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Helena, a frontend developer graduate

I had applied and been accepted for higher education in Marketing Automation, but I was curious about coding and thought it would be a strength, working in digital marketing with coding skills. But, in fact, I enjoyed it so much that I decided to become a software developer instead.

I have studied frontend development for ten months with Code Institute and Sundsgarden FHS. During my studies I have received the knowledge and to appreciate the value of clean, well written code. Code to be reusable and to easily maintain in future codebases. I have valued the collaboration with other students in agile work processes and design web applications to be responsive and inclusive to all users.

New to this industry I take every opportunity to learn from my seniors and peers, alsoI highly encourage and value constructive feedback to be able to grow further in my field. 


- Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TDD through an online course by David Bieder. I am also attending the 10 week Vanilla Javascript course with Chris Ferdinandi to deepen my knowledge in Javascript.
